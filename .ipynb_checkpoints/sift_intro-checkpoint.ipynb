    "## Binary Image matching\n",
    "Through the development of your own image stitching utility, you've learned the utility of being able to match keypoints in images, and how the process is done (find a good keypoint, extract a local descriptor, match these descriptors against each other).  However, the keypoint detection and matching that we implemented ourselves was sub-optimal in the sense that it did not preserve important invariances like rotation and scale.  For our endeavours into 3D scene reconstruction, we will instead switch to the de facto gold standard of keypoint matching methods, known as Scale Invariant Feature Transform, or SIFT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, SIFT works just like Harris Corners, patch descriptors, and normalized SSE, with a few extra tweaks to make it better.  Instead of implementing SIFT ourselves, we will use the excellent implementation from OpenCV.  However, there is a small issue: SIFT is a non-free algorithm (it is free for academic use, but restricted from unlicensed commercial use).  As such it is not bundled with the standard OpenCV library.  Instead, it must be aquired separately.  However, this is made easy using pip (for those of you with linux or mac).  A simple\n",

    "will suffice to get both opencv and the non-free libraries associated with it. \n",

    "Once opencv is installed, it's straightforward to use with numpy.  The generation of SIFT keypoints and detectors is as follows:"
